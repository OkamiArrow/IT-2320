		<p>The first anime that I had ever watched with my little brothers was probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto" target="_blank">Naruto</a>.
   		   It was the easiest anime that we could talk about and relate with.
		   We would sit up for hours and wait for the newest episode to come out. I would always go to the store and buy ther new manga when it was out so we could read
		   it together and talk about the story and who our favorite characters were.

	<h2><span style="color:blue">The Next Phase</span></h2>
	
		<p>As we got older, obviously the shows we were used to watching were ending one by one and we needed to find new ones to watch. But as we grew and changed,
		   so did our taste in what we liked in an anime. Of course we could always go back and watch old episodes of other shows but we were starting to like different
		   shows because of our age gap and that was okay. It made us have to talk about and debate about what we liked and disliked about our new favorites like SteinsGate
		   and Rick And Morty. It was another reason to talk. If it wasn't for these shows my brothers and I might not have gotten so close. They gave us a way to close
		   the age gap that wasn't available before. So for that reason I will always have a great deal of respect and admiration for anime. Below are some animes that I
		   would advise if someone were to ask about what they should watch for a starter anime.
